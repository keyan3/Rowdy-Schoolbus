‘solver3_small.py’ - Randomly partitions the input graph 10000 times, selects the best-scoring random partition as a starting point, then uses a modified simulating annealing algorithm with 80000 iterations to improve upon this approximation.

‘solver3_medium.py’ - Randomly partitions the input graph 5000 times, selects the best-scoring random partition as a starting point, then uses a modified simulating annealing algorithm with 20000 iterations to improve upon this approximation.

‘solver3_small.py’ - Randomly partitions the input graph 3000 times, selects the best-scoring random partition as a starting point, then uses a modified simulating annealing algorithm with 10000 iterations to improve upon this approximation.


To generate outputs, ensure that ‘solver3_small.py’, ’solver3_medium.py’, and ‘solver3_large.py’ are all in a folder with ‘all_inputs’. Then, run the commands ‘python3 solver3_small.py’, ‘python3 solver3_medium.py’, and ‘python3 solver3_large.py’ to generate outputs for small, medium, and large inputs respectively.
